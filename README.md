## scraper
scraping twitter and instagram using selenium [firefox browser]


## twitter
Scrapes the following:
 - Different Tweets from the User Page
 - Getting the Thread link for each Tweet and scraping the following:
   - Name, @Username tag
   - Tweet Text
   - Photo/Video link and downloads it by using **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlpa)** (I can add a do not download option)
   - Card Wrapper Link

Still have a lot to do regarding user input and error handling checker, but all functionality works so far

### instagram
